cloudpatterns
=============

Cloud Computing has been a great enabler in the past few years. Over the years skepticism turned into adoption. It has been a great enabler so far for so many young startups and small and medium businesses to avoid massive upfront investments, waste less of their own resources and the planet's.

This repository is dedicated to a series of articles on Cloud Computing Architecture, the patterns and antipatterns in that domain. There will be a balance between abstract and concrete concepts and any concrete examples will be using FOSS components.
All constructive feedback is welcome. If you are also interested in adding to the repository, please fork and submit pull requests.
